# Python 2025

### These are some projects I worked on as I explored OOP concepts in Python.

## Contact Book

### This project simulates a CLI contact book where users can add, delete, view, edit, and search their contacts.
### Run this by running 'python app.py' in your terminal and then type the command 'help' for a list of actions
### Feel free to play around, as your contact book will save in the form of a json file called 'contact.json'
